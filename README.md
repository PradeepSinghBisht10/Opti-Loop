OptiLoop: Optimal Logistics Circuit Planner

🌟 Project Overview

OptiLoop is a modern, full-stack application designed to solve a critical problem in logistics: finding the shortest path to visit a defined set of mandatory delivery stops before reaching a final destination.

This project serves as a practical demonstration of advanced Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), utilizing a highly visual and interactive interface to make complex computational solutions accessible to operators. It is built using the MERN stack principles and features Gemini AI integration for enhanced operational intelligence.

TLDR: OptiLoop uses Dijkstra's Algorithm and Brute Force Permutations (TSP) to find the globally optimal delivery circuit, then visualizes the path with an animated truck and provides AI-driven summaries.

🚀 Key Features

Core DSA Solver: Implements a Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) variant solver for multiple mandatory stops, built on top of the Dijkstra's Algorithm engine for calculating shortest segment paths.

Real-time Visualization: Displays the entire delivery network as an SVG graph with dynamic elements.

Continuous Animation: A 2D, top-down red delivery truck automatically loops along the optimized circuit, providing continuous visual feedback.

Enhanced Visuals: Features reflective nodes, a glowing optimal path, and blinking key stops to highlight critical information for the operator.

AI Operational Insights: Integrates the Gemini API (Google AI) to instantly generate:

Route Summaries & Risk Assessments.

Professional Operational Report Drafts.

Modern Stack: Built entirely in a single React/JSX file, styled using Tailwind CSS for guaranteed responsiveness and modern UI design.
